ðŸš§ **Work In Progress**: This project is currently under development. Features might be incomplete and changes can be expected.

Housing alerts is a work in progress real estate scraping tool designed to aid potential home buyers/ renters (ME - this is designed for personal use) in their search. Users can specify criteria such as budget, bedrooms, and other preferences. The application then scours the web â€“ from top realtor websites and their social media platforms â€“ in search of homes that match the user's requirements. Once a potential match is found, Django Home Finder will send a notification text to the user.

## Planned Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy input of preferences like budget, bedroom count, etc.
- **Broad Search:** Scans top realtor websites and relevant social media postings.
- **Instant Notifications:** Real-time SMS notifications for matching home listings.

Ensure you have Python (3.8 or higher) and pip installed.

## Planned Usage
- Register an account.
